# ASERT Keyboard Layout

Heatmap coming


## What is this?


ASERT is an alternate keyboard layout. It gives a huge improvement over Qwerty with only minor changes. All letters stay on the same finger! Everything is just an up and down swap, with a 3 letter loop for the N-Y-J loop which still keeps those on the same finger.

This swap brings the common letters to the home row, and moves the less common letters to the top row. This greatly improves the layout and heatmap with minimal changes.

This is incredibly easy to adopt. Nothing changes fingers. Most of the muscle memory remains in place. ASERT doesn’t change all your existing muscle memory and patterns and in fact takes advantage of it.



## Who is this for?

People that have touch typed in Qwerty for a long time and have lots of muscle memory. This muscle memory can not be easily undone and a new layout learned. This is for people that want a better layout to reduce finger travel, reduce fatigue, and reduce RSI.

It’s for people that want an improved layout but don’t want to take the months to truly adapt to a new layout. (Many report a year to go back up to speed).

## So what if the letters stay on the same fingers?

We've spent years and decades associating letters with fingers every time we type. That may seem like a different take on the situation but I think it’s true.

There are two pieces, we associate a letter with

1) a finger, and 

2) a finger movement. 

Do you notice which one came first? I think we primarily associate letters with fingers. We can keep the letter on the finger and modify the finger movement.

We often talk about associating letters with a keyboard location, but I think there’s more to it. If you’re a touch typist you’ve automatically been associating a letter with the finger for a long time, and I think it’s the majority of the brain memory and muscle memory. 

I postulate that keeping the letters on the same finger will greatly improve adoption time. You 1) keep the same letter-finger association and 2) adjust the finger movement. So right out of the gate I think it wins more than half the battle. 

## So this is another halfway measure...

(The following numbers are subjective and made up just to convey the point.)

Minimak4 is 40% of the pain, for 30% of the gain.

NIRO is 50% of the pain for 60% of the gain.

Colemak is 75% of the pain, for 90% of the gain.

Dvorak is 100% of the pain for 90% of the gain.

ASERT is 10% of the pain, for a whopping 70% of the gain. 

ASERT has a huge gain-to-pain ratio. It gives a very high payoff ratio. Great bang for the buck. Great improvement for the minimal effort. However you want to word it. It’s a high payoff ratio. Honestly, I think this is the easiest, fastest, and best payoff for the masses.

This should be dead simple to learn. With so many people stuck on qwerty because of the difficulty of changing, this is a seriously good option. Far, far, far better than qwerty with minimal effort to change. 

## How does this score?

Ease of transition is also not possible to model! All the talk of scores can’t model how easy it is to adopt a new layout. We can run this through analysis programs, but keep in mind they don’t account for the biggest and main advantages of this layout: keeping the muscle memory and ease of transition.




## But you are changing muscle memory.

I know what you're saying. Locations yes, but I think the association of letters with fingers is the far stronger one.

When I learnt Colemak I found my fingers want their old letters quite often - not the old key locations, their old letters. E.g. my right middle finger wants to type I, even in the qwerty K position. My right ring finger wants to type O, in the qwerty L position. I found my fingers were associated with the old letters and that was very hard to change,

The Colemak T, N, and J keys were the easiest to learn, I think because they were the same finger. All the letters that changed fingers were hard and slow to learn. 

## Wait, you don’t use ASERT?

I was too far into Colemak when I saw row-swap and added the NYJ loop. I no longer had that muscle memory, so the entire advantage and purpose of ASERT was already lost to me. If I saw ASERT first, I have no doubt I would have tried it.

## So... Is this a good layout?

ASERT is not analyzed or optimized for bigrams, alternating hands, rolls, etc. So is it good? It’s not exactly made* to be “good”. It takes advantage of swaps to get the frequent letters to the home row. If you use this you have to acknowledge it's not an analyzed, “optimized" layout, it’s just a far better one that's very, incredibly, easy as pie to transition to.

*Actually it’s not made or designed at all. It’s taking advantage of some very simple swaps that happen to appear from the Qwerty layout. Really these changes have been lying under our noses the whole time.

## But if it’s not optimized, what’s the point?

To get the most commonly used keys to the home row! That will:

1) Reduce travel distance.

On QWERTY you have to reach up to press the E, R, diagonal stretch for the T, reach down for the N, reach up for the I, the O. Putting these on the home row greatly reduces the number of times you have to leave the home row. 

2) Reduce the strain of reaching (like reaching for the T and Y).

You really have to reach for T and Y. I expect putting the less common G and rare J up there will really reduce strain.

## Is the NYJ loop really that easy?

That’s likely the hardest change because it’s not the same up down as the others. But it keeps all the letters on the same finger!

Moving the N into the home row is worth it. When you get used to keeping your hands on the home row you realize how terrible the qwerty Y location is, putting the displaced J there is a good move from Colemak. And then putting Y in the qwerty N is a serendipitous loop that keeps all of them on the same finger!

## But it still changes 15 keys compared to [other layout’s n keys].

There’s far more to it than the number of keys changed. Keeping all the letters on the same finger and taking advantage of existing brain and muscle memory keeps it easy and is a huge advantage. These changes are way easier to learn than completely rejumbling n number of keys.

But it keeps the same finger bigrams ED and OL

If you’re looking to minimize SFB you’ll want to adopt a layout that’s designed like Colemak. If you want ease of transition and to take advantage of old muscle memory, then keeping old bigrams is a feature, not a bug. 

## Who is this not for?

If you want full, analyzed, designed optimization, it’s not for you.

If you’re NOT heavily ingrained in qwerty, you can consider a more optimized layout. 

If you can take the time to learn, consider a more optimized layout.

## Who is this for again?

Those that want a very easy change to a much improved layout.

Those that are heavily ingrained in Qwerty and don’t think they can make big changes like Colemak.

Those that can’t take the downtime (~1-3 months) to become somewhat proficient/productive again.

Those that don’t want to take ~year to come back up to speed.

## Q: https://xkcd.com/927/

We had a single standard: Qwerty. Except it sucks. But we had it. This isn’t about standardization, this is about improvement. That better layout can be decided at an individual level with whatever matches your case scenario.


# SPECIFIC DESIGN QUESTIONS

But the T (and H) isn’t under a finger.

Unfortunately no, but they are on the home row at least. Much improved over Qwerty.

Any changes to get T under a finger starts you down the rabbithole while breaking bigrams and trigrams. Ugh. The goal of ASERT is using your old muscle memory and an easy transition.

## A vowel in the bottom row?

It does seem weird doesn't it? But the letter frequency is fine. The LY bigram is comfortable. Much better spot than its qwerty position. 

(BTW the history of Qwerty is the vowels were placed in the top row. The A moved, but the rest remained. This gives us the whole opportunity to row swap most of them into the home row! Anyway, I think that's why a vowel in the bottom row seems weird.)

## The left hand is still overloaded

Yes, there’s no getting around that without moving keys to the right hand, which necessitates moving displaced keys back to the left. It gets messy very quickly and away from the goal of using muscle memory and easy transition. You can see possible changes below.

BUT the common complaint about the left hand is tiredness. I think a large part of that is from constant reaching and stretching. Reach for E, reach for R, diagonal stretch for T. Moving ERT, even T not under a finger, should alleviate some of this. Yes you still reach for T but it’s a shorter reach. All 3 combined and it could be enough to really help*. This is subjective, so need user feedback.
 
[*Especially if fatigue is exponential with use and not linear. With working out, say you’re lifting something for a set of 10, the first 5 reps are easy. Then the next 3 are a bit harder. But the last 1 or 2 are wayyy harder. Fatigue went up exponentially with reps. Does this happen with fingers? I don’t see why not. So good enough might actually be good enough, in addition to the advantages of keeping muscle memory.



# OTHER KEYBOARDS

## MiniMak:
This is not too dissimilar in it's goal, but it starts with moving the E to the right hand. So two keys change hands entirely. Then the T moves to D, which is an odd finger change. I expect this alone is far a harder change, it breaks lots of bigrams/trigrams, and with far less payoff. And it reverses the “order” of the RT to TR, also a hard change. That’s a lot of upset and it doesn’t seem worth it. After that the changes for Minimak 8 and 12 are similar to row swaps here, but it reverses the RT order and I'm a bigger fan of the NYJ loop of ASERT. If you do Minimak, I don't see why you'd stop at 4 (the hardest change) or 8, go for all 12. But even 12 I think ASERT has more letters in better positions, maintains bi/trigams, keeps muscle memory, and an easier transition. ASERT imo is better on all fronts.

## ASSET:
The home row shares a lot of characteristics. The creator of ASSET likely saw many of the same opportunities. But I think this better placement of all the other keys on the top row, bottom row, center columns. The D, J, U, K, G, Y are in better spots. This has fewer letters change fingers, no extra unnecessary changes, and this maintains more muscle memory and is easier to learn. IMO a big win over ASSET. You can also see possible changes below.

## Norman:
Some users really dislike the centre column, finding it hard/tiring to reach. If that’s the case there's not many options without a lot of change. To get common letters out of the centre columns along the ASERT concepts, the best solution is the Norman layout (if you just want the T out, also see ASETG below). The notable thing about Norman is that it rebalances the fingers so the index fingers aren’t overloaded (they have a total of 6 keys to press, instead of the normal 3 keys). All the changes are to the point and well thought out for its goals. IMO it doesn't get the attention it deserves. It will have a steeper learning curve than ASERT, but less than Colemak/Workman.

## Tarmak:
Good for transition to Colemak. But imo you don’t want to stop on any one step, the result just isn’t there.

## The big boys of Colemak/Dvorak/Workman:
They change a lot for optimization. The goal of ASERT is ease of transition and keeping muscle memory. Different goals for different people.


## History and Origin of Row swap 

I just happened to see row swap here.
https://www.slant.co/options/21471/~row-swap-qwdfgy-review

Created a heatmap for it: https://imgur.com/5gOjvgv

May have found the original creator Phynnboi (inactive) who called it ASERTH in Dec 2008 https://forum.colemak.com/topic/42-what-makes-colemak-better-than-the-alternatives/

Found another person who made it independently in 2016 and called it ASERT https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/5jxsv8/i_designed_a_new_keyboard_layout_a_simple_qwerty/

After looking at it for a while, I added the NYJ loop instead of U-J swap. This is a much better change, even though it breaks the pattern of just up and down, to get the common N under a finger, Y into a good spot, and infrequent J into a bad spot. Thus it becomes ASERT-NIOP instead of row swap. Heatmap: https://imgur.com/ComDNbR
