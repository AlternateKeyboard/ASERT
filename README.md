# ASERT Keyboard Layout

## What is this?


ASERT is an alternate keyboard layout. It gives a huge improvement over Qwerty with only minor changes. All letters stay on the same finger! Everything is just an up and down swap, with a 3 letter loop for the N-Y-J loop which still keeps those on the same finger.

This swap brings the common letters to the home row, and moves the less common letters to the top row. This greatly improves the layout and heatmap with minimal changes.

This is incredibly easy to adopt. Nothing changes fingers. Most of the muscle memory remains in place. ASERT doesn’t change all your existing muscle memory and patterns and in fact takes advantage of it.



## Who is this for?

People that have touch typed in Qwerty for a long time and have lots of muscle memory. This muscle memory can not be easily undone and a new layout learned. This is for people that want a better layout to reduce finger travel, reduce fatigue, and reduce RSI.

It’s for people that want an improved layout but don’t want to take the months to truly adapt to a new layout. (Many report a year to go back up to speed).

## So what if the letters stay on the same fingers?

We've spent years and decades associating letters with fingers every time we type. That may seem like a different take on the situation but I think it’s true.

There are two pieces, we associate a letter with

1) a finger, and 

2) a finger movement. 

Do you notice which one came first? I think we primarily associate letters with fingers. We can keep the letter on the finger and modify the finger movement.

We often talk about associating letters with a keyboard location, but I think there’s more to it. If you’re a touch typist you’ve automatically been associating a letter with the finger for a long time, and I think it’s the majority of the brain memory and muscle memory. 

I postulate that keeping the letters on the same finger will greatly improve adoption time. You 1) keep the same letter-finger association and 2) adjust the finger movement. So right out of the gate I think it wins more than half the battle.
